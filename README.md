A little password generator-project I did for my apprenticeship. 

In the "basefuntion.py" you have the basic 7 lines you would need for a pwgenerator

In the "main.py" you have the code for a pwgenerator in which you can just say how many characters your password should have, not specificly which kind of characters.

In the "rework_main.py" you have the code for a pwgenerator in which you can actually say how many letters, numbers and symbols you want to have. 

In the "PW-Gen-with-gui.py" you have a fully functional PW-Generator with an GUI. 
  You can adjust how many letters, numbers and symbols you want to have and copy it by clicking on the "Kopieren" button.
  
The comments in the code itself are in german atm but I will uplaod a version with english comments sometime soon. 

To use the passwordgenerator you will need PySimpleGUI and pyperclip (if you dont already have it installed)



If you have any tips on what I could've done better or different feel free to contact me here.
